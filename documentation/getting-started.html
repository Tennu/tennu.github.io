<h2>Foreward</h2>

<p>
  In this tutorial, we will be creating a bot that responds to a
  <code class="command">!givemeblt</code> command. This command will
  give the requesting user a juicy BLT for their troubles.
</p>

<p>
  From this, you will learn a few useful things:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>How to install Tennu</li>
  <li>How to create a plugin with  commands</li>
  <li>How to start your bot</li>
</ol>

<p class="notice">
  Note: Tennu is beta-quality software. There are rough edges, and
  updates will often bring backwards-incompatible changes. Be prepared
  to either stay on the version you are using, or to change your code
  when updating. Likewise, Tennu is not feature complete.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
  Tennu is a <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> framework.
  You must have Node.js installed to use Tennu.
</p>

<p>
  Create a new Node.js project. If you've never done this before,
  here is a simple process for doing so:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a directory to store your project.</li>
  <li>Open up the directory in your console.</li>
  <li>Type <code class="shell">npm init</code> and answer its questions.</li>
  <li>Type <code class="shell">npm install tennu -g</code>. You may have to prepend with <code>sudo</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Your project should now have a <code>package.json</code> file.
  We will be adding two more items:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>config.json</dt>
  <dd>All configuration data for your bot will be located in this file.</dd>

  <dt>tennu_plugins</dt>
  <dd>Your plugins will be located in this directory.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="notice">
  If you can't install Tennu globally, you can also install it locally, without the -g flag.
  If you plan on distributing your bot to others, you should install it locally anyways.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>
  We will start with the configuration file. Take this
  <a href="https://json.org">JSON</a>, and save it in <code>config.json</code>.
<p>

{% highlight javascript %}
{
    "server": "irc.your-network.net",
    "password": null,
    "port": 6667,
    "nickname": "BLTBot",
    "username": "blt",
    "realname": "BLTBot in tennu",
    "channels": [],
    "nickserv": "nickserv",
    "auth-password": null,
    "plugins": ["blt"],
    "command-trigger": "!",
    "disable-help": false
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  You will want to change these values for your bot, specifically `server` and `channels`.
<p>

<p class="notice">
  You can have your bot identify to services (the service named by `nickserv`) by setting
  the `auth-password` option to the password. You must first register the nickname on the
  server. See <a href="registering-bots">here</a> for more details.
</p>

<p class="notice">
  If you want the commmand trigger to be a different character, say
  <code>@</code> instead of <code>!</code>, change the `command-trigger` property.
</p>

<p>
  The plugins property already contains a plugin, <code>blt</code>. We haven't
  written it yet, but this will be its name. Any plugins you want to load,
  including their dependencies, must be listed in this array.
  The only exception are the plugins built into Tennu itself:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="/plugins/server">Server</a></dt>
  <dd>Exposes functions that give information about the server.</dd>

  <dt><a href="/plugins/action">Action</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Coming in Tennu 0.10.0, this plugin provides the actions your bot uses
    to do things on the server. These commands are also available on the
    client object.
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="/plugins/user">User</a></dt>
  <dd>Exposes functions that give information about the server's users.</dd>

  <dt><a href="/plugins/channel">Channel</a></dt>
  <dd>Exposes functions that give information about the server's channels.</dd>

  <dt><a href="/plugins/help">Help</a></dt>
  <dd>Controls the commands !help and !commands</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">
  Most of these plugins currently expose no functionality.
</p>

<h2>Writing the BLT Module</h2>

<p>
  In the previous section, we named the plugin <code>BLT</code>. As such,
  our plugin will be located at <code>tennu_plugins/blt.js</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Here are the contents of <code>tennu_plugins/blt.js</code>.
</p>

{% highlight JavaScript %}
var BLTPlugin = {
    init: function (client, imports) {
        return {
            handlers: {
                '!givemeblt': function (command) {
                    client.act(command.channel, 'gives a juicy BLT to ' + command.nickname);
                }
            },

            help: {
                'command': [
                    '!givemeblt',
                    ' ',
                    'Gives the requestor a juicy BLT.'
                ]
            },

            commands: ['givemeblt']
        }
    }
};

module.exports = BLTPlugin;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  We send an action to the server in the channel the command came from giving
  the BLT to the nickname the command originated from.
</p>

<p>
  If you have never used Node.js before, the final line may confuse you.
  It just means that the Node module is exporting the object at
  <code>BLTPlugin</code>. If it was not there, Tennu (or any other node module)
  would not be able to access the plugin.
</p>

<p>
  Given this example, every Tennu Plugin file should look something like this:
</p>

{% highlight JavaScript %}
var TennuPluginName = {
    init: function (client, imports) {
        // Initialization of the plugin.

        return {
            exports: {
                // Exported properties.
            },

            handlers: {
                '!command': function (command) {
                    // Handle the command
                }
            },

            help: {
                'command': [
                    '!command &lt;command&gt;',
                    ' ',
                    'Help info about command.'
                ]
            },

            commands: ['command']
        }
    }
};

module.exports = TennuModuleName;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  The Tennu plugin is an object with a single property, <code>init</code>.
  This property contains a function that takes two
  values, <code>client</code> and <code>imports</code>. The client is
  the reference to Tennu, and your way of accessing all of the functionality
  the library provides outside of the hooks described here. The imports
  object contains the exports properties of plugins that you require. This
  plugin does not require any other plugins, so it is an empty object.
</p>

<p>
  The <code>init</code> function returns an object, known as the plugin
  instance, with various properties (all optional):
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>exports</dt>
  <dd>Values that are passed to other plugins when they require your plugin.</dd>

  <dt>handlers</dt>
  <dd>
    This is an object where the property names are the
    <a href="/documentation/api/message">messages</a> and command
    types to listen to, and the functions are the handlers for that message
    or command type.
  </dd>

  <dt>help</dt>
  <dd>
    This is a hook for the <a href="/plugins/help">help</a> plugin to
    provide help for your commands and other topics.
  </dd>

  <dt>commands</dt>
  <dd>
    This is also a hook for the <a href="/plugins/help">help</a> plugin
    to list the commands provided by your bot.
  </dd>

  <dt>hooks</dt>
  <dd>
    Mentioned here for completeness, see <a href="/documentation/hooks">hooks</a>.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  Comparing this to our bot, our bot does not export any values, and has one
  command handler that is documented. It does not do any special initialization.
</p>

<h2>Running Your Bot</h2>

<p>
  Tennu comes with a command line utility for starting bots.
</p>

<p>
  From the command line, in your project directory, utter this incantation:
</p>

<p><code class="shell">tennu config.json -v</code></p>

<p>
  This command says run your tennu bot with the configuration located at
  <code>config.json</code> with verbose output.
</p>

<p class="note">
  If you want your bot not to log to the console, leave off the -v flag.
</p>

<p>
  For extra utility, put this command into the scripts property of
  your <code>package.json</code> file.
</p>

{% highlight JavaScript %}
{
    // ...
    "scripts": {
        "start": "tennu config.json -v"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Now you can just type <code class="shell">npm start</code> to start your bot.
</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>
    If you plan on distributing your bot, you should run the following shell command:
  </p>

  <code>npm install --save tennu</code>

  <p>
    This will put a local copy of tennu into <code>node_modules/</code> and add it
    to the dependencies object in the <code>package.json</code> file.
  </p>
</div>
