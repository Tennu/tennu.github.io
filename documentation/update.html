<h2>v0.7.x to v.0.8.x</h2>

<p>Change any nullary argument usage of Client#nick to Client#nickname</p>

<p>IrcOutputSocket methods (other than plain raws) return promises.</p>

<h2>v0.6.x to v.07.x</h2>

<p>
Client.nick()'s nullary functionality (of returning the current nickname)
has been deprecated, and will be removed in v.0.8.x. Instead, use
Client.nickname().
</p>

<p>The unary version of Client.nick(newNick) is unchanged.</p>

<p>The idea is that a method should do one thing, and this one currently does two.</p>


<p>
You now have access to eight logging levels (debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit, alert, error).
Use them as needed.
</p>

<p>
You may need to pass a Logger to your Client. If so, I suggest using Winston.
</p>

<h2>From v0.5.x to v0.6.x</h2>

<pre>
    Message and Command objects have property name changes to align with the
    irc-message module.

    In Message, the following property changes occurred:

    * args -> params
    * sender -> hostmask
    ** hostmask properties have "name" added to the end of it.
    * actor -> nickname
    * name -> command

    For Nickname Messages:

    * newNick -> new

    For Command objects

    * name -> command
</pre>

<h2>Earlier</h2>

<p>Any modules you have will need to be rewritten.</p>

<p>Too many things have changed in subtle things.</p>
