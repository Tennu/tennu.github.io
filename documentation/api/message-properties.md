## Message Properties

Note: If you would like to improve Tennu, adding message extensions is easy.

### All Messages

* prefix     - The prefix is either a hostmask of the format "nickname!username@hostname", or the server you are connected to.
* command    - Message command type. For example, 'privmsg' or 'nick'.
* params     - Array of sent parameters.
* tags       - IRC3 tags sent with message.

### Messages With Hostmask Prefixes

If the message has a hostmask as a prefix, then the `hostmask` property will
be set to an object with three properties:

* nickname
* username
* hostname

Otherwise, this property will be null.

### `nickname` Property

Most messages have a `nickname` property.

For messages that have a hostmask as a prefix, the `nickname` is an alias to `message.hostmask.nickname`.

### `channel` Property

Messages that happen in a specific channel have a `channel` property.

The channel is normalized to lower case.

### `replyname` Property

Numerics that are listed on this article have this property. It is the name given to the numeric
by [alien.net.au](https://www.alien.net.au/irc/irc2numerics.html). These messages are also emitted by the
value of their reply name.

### PRIVMSG and NOTICE

* isQuery - Whether or not the message was sent directly to you, or to a channel.
* channel - In the case of a query, the channel is the nickname of the user who sent the message.
* message - The message, stripped of mIRC color codes and trimmed.
