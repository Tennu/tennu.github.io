<h2>Using a Public Tennu Plugin</h2>

<p>Some Tennu plugins are hosted on `npm` for everybody to use.</p>

<p>Using them is really easy. There are four simple steps to using them.</p>

<p>For this example, we'll be using `tennu-admin` and `tennu-control` to allow you to use commands like `!join` and `!part` to control your bot from IRC while it is running.</p>

<h3>1) Find the Plugin</h3>

<p>You can search [npmjs.org](//npmjs.org) for plugins, or look at the <a href="//www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/tennu-plugin">tennu-plugin</a> tag for various plugins.</p>

<p>You can also see the <a href="/plugins/index">list</a> of plugins documented on this site.</p>

<p>Their package name will always start with `"tennu-"`.</p>

<p>For our example, you can find their respective packages at
<a href="//npmjs.org/package/tennu-admin">tennu-admin</a> &amp;
<a href="//npmjs.org/package/tennu-control">tennu-control</a>.</p>

<h3>2) Install the Plugin</h3>

<p>In your bot's project directory, use `npm install %package-name%`.</p>

<p>This will place the package in `./node_modules/%package-name%`.</p>

<p>For our example, we need to install both of them.

<code class="shell">npm install tennu-admin
npm install tennu-control</code>

<h3>3) Add the plugins to your configuration.</h3>

<p>In your configuration file, append the names of the plugins
to the `"plugins"` array.</p>

<p>The name of the plugin is the package name without the `"tennu-"` prefix.</p>

<p>For our example, we have this line in your `config.json`:</p>

{% highlight JavaScript %}
"plugins": ["admin", "control"]
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>4) Add any configuration requested by the plugin.</h3>

<p>Not all plugins need configuration, but for those that do, add it.</p>

<p>For our example, `tennu-control` takes no configuration, but `tennu-admin` does.</p>

<p>Specifically, we need to add an "admins" property to our configuration. A basic example for this property is as follows.</p>

{% highlight JavaScript %}
"admins": [{"identifiedas": "your-nickname"}]
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you get the configuration wrong, you will not be able to use any of the commands provided by `tennu-control`, since they'll respond with "Permission denied.".</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>After installing your plugin, you should start your bot and test to make sure you have the commands and that the configuration is correct.</p>
