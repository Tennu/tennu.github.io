title: Subscriber Plugin
---

<p class="built-in">This plugin is built-in.</p>

<p>This plugin provides the <code>handlers</code> plugin hook from which you can subscribe to <code>messages</code>' and <code>commands</code>' event emitters, amongst others. When write a plugin, this is how you are supposed to subscribe to these events. Each event type has a prefix with exception to the <code>messages</code> event emitter which requires no prefix.</p>

<!-- TODO(Havvy): Discussion about space delimited names, example usage. -->

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p class="none">None</p>

<h2>Exports</h2>

<dl>
    <dt><code>on</code>, <code>off</code>, <code>once</code></dt>
    <!-- TODO(Havvy): Finish this sentence. -->
    <dd>These three functions take an object where the strings are the events to...</dd>

    <dt><code>defaultPrefix: Sentinel object</code></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>The sentinel value passed to the subscribe hook's prefix property to specify that you are adding a default subscriber.</p>
        <p>You shouldn't need to use this, since Tennu already uses the default subscriber for messages.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Plugin Hooks</h2>

<h3><code>subscribe: {prefix: String, emitter: EventEmitter}</code></h3>

<p>This hook lets you add a new event emitter for the subscriber to dispatch to.</p>

<p class="note">Note: A plugin may only add one subscription. If you need to add more, file an <a href="https://github.com/Tennu/tennu/issues">issue.</a>.</p>

<p>It is recommended that non-built-in plugins set the prefix as some word related to the plugin followed by a colon. For example, when the <code>ctcp</code> plugin is written, it'll subscribe the prefix <code>"ctcp:"</code>.</p>

<h3><cod>handlers: Object&lt;EventNames, Handler&gt;</code></h3>
