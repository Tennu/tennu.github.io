<p class="built-in">This plugin is built-in.</p>

<p>This plugin listens to <a href="messages"><code>privmsg</code></a> events, determining whether it's a command invocation, creating a <a href="/documentation/api-/command-properties"><code>Command</code></a> and firing off a command event when it is. The event name is the name of the command. You can subscribe to these events using the <a href="subscriber"><code>handlers</code></a> plugin hook.</p>

<h3>Config</h3>

<dl>
    <dt><code>ignored-commands: [String]</code></dt>
    <dd>A list of commands that the handler will not be called for. Useful for when you only want specific commands from a plugin.</dd>
